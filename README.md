# ASD Cause Prediction
  Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental-related mental disorder. With the improvement and application of machine learning techniques in classification problems, the problem of maintaining a high accuracy of ASD diagnosis could be solved through that. However, studies that focus on using machine learning methods to diagnose ASD suffer from data issues, such as trust in using models and feature selection. This present project examines 298 children and 108 adolescents samples from two datasets by using the Random Forest Algorithm. We obtained that the two models both have 100\% accuracy and the "result" feature contributes the most. And the models with neither only "A1-A10" nor only "features unrelated to AQ-10" show weak predictive validity.
